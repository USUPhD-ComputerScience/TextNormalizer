Angry Birds I have been a fan of Angry Birds since the beginning. But this is ridiculous. The recent updates have flooded the game with more ads and iAP purchases than necessary. Clearly showing your greed, Rovio. Cut it back by 80000 notches. I have started to avoid any app that offers iAP purchases. Not that I don't appreciate the addition of powerups, but if you want more money, don't include iAP purchases, raise the price of your game! If it's a good game, people will buy it no matter the cost. Take this advice, Rovio. People will be more inclined to support you if you're not milking every dime you can out of them.
Hey! I updated and it's a very poor update! I updated my iOS software and it's not that or my phone. You said we were to get "the new shock wave and unless that was a mislead, all I got was the first ones, the crappy update and crashes.Please update again. I know you can do better, Rovio!Glad to see I'm not the only one dissatisfied.
Granny Still like the game, the pop up adds, not so much.
Angry Birds The game gets stuck till i when i have to restart it again.Fix this!
Love this new update It just make angry bird more fun with the electric shock I can't wait for a new episode of the game
Not liking update! The game is fun for anyone, however the update no longer lets you listen to music (iTunes).  I used to play on long flights and enjoyed the ability to listen to my tunes but, I no longer play on planes or that often.
Angry birds addict This is the best game EVER!
REALLY??? Stop making games and make one game at a time better because this is just sad now
Cool game! The game is really fun but I wish that you could earn coins to buy power ups instead of using real money. (From my 9 year old :)
Pop ups galore Chill with the doo doo
Awsome Im just rating to get a golden egg
about time a good update I'm happy the old music is back and this wasn't an update for the stupid red mighty feathers. But I have to rate it 4 stars because you made the menu worse looking.
Angry birds I love the new levels they are very challenging . You should make more levels . I love angry birds.And you should sign with sponge bob squarepants for an app .And you should youse Billy Joel music for your background sound.
Like the game, want control over videos I like the game and there always seem to be more levels than I have time to master. This game is heavily marketed to kids - fine by me, my kid loves the blankets and bath towels and t-shirts - but they've added videos to the app you can't turn off anywhere in the settings. I don't want my kid idly watching cartoons, I don't mind playing games. Give us the ability to turn off cartoons some way other than putting the iPod into airplane mode! He has learning apps that need the network, which makes this app a pain for me.
Angry Birds ABs has kept me captivated for a couple of yrs.. Over time, I have become quite skilled at it. The newest versions are not winnable without purchasing additional "fighters." Not a fair contest. I am highly disappointed to find that difficult levels are unachievable without purchasing additional " power ups." That simply defeats the purpose in trying to reach certain levels through skill.
Annoyances aplenty I loved this game when I first bought it. It has gradually become a cash-grab operation plagued with ads (in a paid app? Come on) and pop-ups (buy some IAPs already you walking wallets, or better yet, sign up for something you don't have any reason to. No, you can't decline. You can close the window, but it will be back next level) I foolishly bought the giant eagle add-on (advertised as unlimited use) but now it requires a cool down time. How that isn't just straight-up false advertising makes no sense to me. Well, I'm sure they need the IAP income. They must all be starving after making an obscene amount of money from this game already.
I paid to not have ads yet... the game has ads. Not cool. If there were no ads, I'd probably buy the Star Wars one but... nope.
Angry Birds Lord Of The Rings? Nice game but has anyone thought of Angry Birds Lord Of The Rings? That would be cool if they did it right
Finnaly something new! I love the moving targets! And to all those people that plan to quit cuz they dont like these moving targets...just dont play those! Duh
